  Our project is the classic Pacman game recreated using OCaml. The interface
  allows users is to control the movement of the Pacman character around a 
  maze with ghosts chasing the character. The Pacman character moves around 
  the maze trying to collect the pellets, power pellets, and cherries 
  without being caught by a ghost.

  The Pacman has three lives represented as hearts on the screen and each
  time the Pacman character is caught by a ghost one of the hearts is broken.
  Once all three hearts are broken the game ends.

  The ghosts' speed cycles through different modes including fast, slow, regular, 
  and paused. Pac-Man's speed also increases as the game continues. There are
  is an additional feature where Pac-Man is able to eat a ghost after gaining
  powers from eating a power pellet.
